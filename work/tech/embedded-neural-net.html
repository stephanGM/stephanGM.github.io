                        This Project was for an embedded systems course at McGill (ECSE 421). <br>
                        If you're interested you can 
                        <a target="_blank" href="../../file/tay-neural-network.pdf"> read the report </a> or if you have access to labView,

                        The objective achieved was to create a multi-layered neural network that could be trained to know its orientation in XYZ space. <br>
                        This was done on National Instrument's myRio board with labView, using the accelerometer data.
                        The neural net was 3 layers deep (1 input, 1 output, 1 hidden) and could easily and quickly be trained using backpropagation. <br>

                        The basic neural net used:

                        The design for a "neuron" in this network as well as a basic understanding of feedforward and backpropagation was thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~quocle/tutorial1.pdf">this</a> tutorial. Furthermore, Matt Mazur's <a target="_blank" href="https://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/"> backpropagation example</a> was also extremely useful when it came to implementing the algorithm.

                    <p>
                        The design space offered by the myRio was also explored to determine a paretto optimal point. This was done through testing performance of code sections accelerated on the FPGA as well as using different number representations. The results can seen in the <a target="_blank" href="../../file/tay-neural-network.pdf">project report</a> which shows that the best result was achieved using fixed point representation on the processor. <br>
