                            This project was developed for my Micro Processors class at McGill University (ECSE 426).<br>
                            The goal was to turn a 32-bit ARM cortex MCU board 
                            (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html"> STM32F4 Discovery</a>) 
                            into a mouse which used the USB interface to communicate with the computer, and then to have it function wirelessly over bluetooth.<br>
                            The report on mainly the bluetooth functionlity of the system can be seen <a target="_blank" href="../../file/final_report_microp.pdf">here</a>.<br>
                            The board was programmed using <b>embedded C</b>.

                            MCU Board - STM32F4 Discovery:

                            <br>
                            This was acheieved by using the pitch and roll data from the accelerometer to move the mouse up and down and side to side. 
                            <br>
                            The buttons were attached via GPIO and configured such that the mouse could support all standard presses (single, double, long). 
                            <br>
                            Once the mouse functionality was tested, itegration of wireless operation over bluetooth begain. 
                            This used one board as a sender and another as a receiver, 
                            communicating with two of TI's' <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ti.com/product/cc2500">CC2500</a>.
